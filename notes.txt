✦ I've created the "NeonNotes" project in the neon_notes folder.

  Project Structure:
   * app.py: The Flask application logic (Backend).
   * templates/index.html: The beautiful dark-mode UI (Frontend).
   * requirements.txt: Python dependencies.

  Your Goal:
   1. Create a `Dockerfile` in neon_notes/ for the Flask app.
       * Hint: Base image python:3.9-slim.
       * Hint: Copy requirements.txt, install them, then copy the rest.
   2. Create a `docker-compose.yaml` to run:
       * The `web` service (your Flask app).
       * The `redis_db` service (Image: redis:alpine).
       * Important: In app.py, I set the host to redis_db. Make sure your service name in docker-compose.yaml matches this exactly!

  Go ahead and create the files! This one is going to look great.
